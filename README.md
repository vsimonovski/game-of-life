# Smallpdf Challenge: Game of Life

Hi Vladimir!

The goal of this challenge is to write a simple version of the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) within the next 4 hours.

* Only the usage of React and TypeScript is mandatory in your solution.
* It's preferred to use the NPM packages already installed and writing you own code over adding new libs/utils.
* Feel free to change this boilerplate structure to fit your needs.
* You can choose which feature to implement along with the game.
* Please include an imaginary todo list in the repository of what could be changed or improved if you had more time.
* We are going to look at your code in terms of simplicity, structure, and style.
* Notify us by email when you're done.

Do not hesitate to email us if you have questions about the challenge.
